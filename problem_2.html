    <h1>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers</h1>
    <div class="problem_content">
        <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the first <b>10</b> terms will be:
            <b>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</b></p>
        <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>    </div>
